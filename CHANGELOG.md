# Changelog

All notable changes to SynHydro are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- `HMMKNNGenerator` moved from `synhydro.methods.generation.hybrid` to the
  unexported `synhydro.methods.generation._dev` module and removed from the
  public API, README, and documentation. The regime-conditioned HMM + KNN
  combination is an experimental prototype that has not been verified
  against a published method.

### Added
- Verification suite (`synhydro.verification`) for statistical property
  preservation, following the Stedinger and Taylor (1982) terminology:
  registered per-metric functions across nine categories (marginal,
  temporal, seasonal, annual, spatial, fdc, lmoments, extremes,
  spectral), a `verify()` orchestrator, and a `VerificationResult` with
  tidy `to_dataframe()`, `summary()` (including the observed value's
  rank position within the ensemble), and `category_summary()`.
  Metric selection is explicit (`metrics="all"`, names, categories, or
  callables); custom metrics register via `register_metric()`.
- Validation suite (`synhydro.validation`) for fit-for-purpose drought
  evaluation: `validate()` runs the threshold-drought and SSI-drought
  categories, relocated from the old validation framework with
  computations unchanged (verified bit-identical on a fixed-seed
  ensemble).
- Frequency-aware evaluation: ensemble frequency is normalized from
  metadata (including plain-word values), checked against the index,
  and used to gate metrics (7-day low flows daily-only, Hurst on
  annual aggregation with a 20-year minimum) and to report events per
  year.
- Rewritten `bootstrap_metric_ci` (vectorized) and `compare_methods`
  (true paired bootstrap when realization counts match) operating on
  the tidy result frame.
- Plotting: `plot_metric_distributions` (per-metric boxplots with
  observed overlay and rank annotation) and `plot_metric_curve`
  (ensemble band for FDC, ACF, monthly statistics, spectra).

- `NowakDisaggregator` generalized to arbitrary discrete timescale pairs via
  `input_timestep` / `output_timestep` constructor arguments: any input in
  {annual, monthly, weekly} disaggregates to any finer output in
  {monthly, weekly, daily} (six pairs). Weekly timesteps follow the ISO
  52-week convention (Sunday anchors, week 53 folded into week 52 pools),
  consistent with `KirschGenerator`. For monthly-to-weekly, weeks are
  assigned to the calendar month containing their Sunday anchor. Monthly to
  daily remains the default and its output is bit-identical to the previous
  implementation for a given seed (guarded by a golden-file regression test
  in `tests/test_nowak_regression.py`).
- `KirschGenerator` now supports weekly resolution in addition to monthly.
  `preprocessing(..., timestep="weekly")` aggregates daily input to ISO weekly
  (W-SUN) buckets, drops ISO week 53, and runs the Kirsch (2013) algorithm with
  52 periods per year and a 26-period half-shift. Monthly remains the default
  and is auto-detected when no `timestep` is supplied. Pre-aggregated weekly
  input (W-SUN family aliases) is also accepted.
- ARFIMA MA(q) component with CSS estimation and BIC-based order selection
- KNN Bootstrap generator for nonparametric multi-site generation
- Valencia-Schaake temporal disaggregation method
- Validation framework with 12 metric categories:
  - L-moment ratios, GEV extreme-value metrics
  - CRPS and SSI drought metrics
  - Bootstrap hypothesis testing module
- Month blending for Nowak disaggregation
- Input validation with warnings for poor data quality
- Pre-commit lint hook
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- MkDocs documentation site with algorithm reference pages

### Changed
- `Ensemble.to_hdf5` writes substantially smaller files (about 35 percent
  smaller on a 10-realization, 5-site, 30-year daily benchmark; 5.9 MB to
  3.8 MB) with faster writes. Dates are now stored once as a fixed-length
  byte-string dataset and hard-linked into every group (variable-length
  strings bypassed HDF5 compression and were duplicated per site), and
  numeric datasets use the shuffle filter when compression is enabled.
  The on-disk layout (group per site with `date`, per-realization
  datasets, and a `column_labels` attribute) is unchanged and remains
  readable by pywrdrb; files written by older versions still load with
  `Ensemble.from_hdf5`.
- `Ensemble.to_hdf5` gained a `dtype` argument, defaulting to
  `"float32"`, which roughly halves file size again (about 68 percent
  total reduction on the benchmark) while keeping about 7 significant
  digits. Pass `dtype="float64"` (or None for the data's native dtype)
  to restore full-precision storage.
- Breaking: `validate_ensemble` and `compute_realization_metrics` are
  removed. Use `synhydro.verify()` for statistical verification and
  `synhydro.validate()` for drought validation. `ValidationResult` now
  refers to the fit-for-purpose result object.
- Breaking: `plot_validation_panel` is now `plot_verification_panel`.
  Rank-sum and Levene panels test each realization separately instead
  of pooling realizations (pooled p-values shrank with ensemble size),
  and the observed-year resampling accepts a `seed`.
- `fit_gev` returns the shape parameter in a single convention for
  both fitting methods (Hosking kappa, equal to the scipy `genextreme`
  c parameter). The L-moment fit previously had a sign error in the
  location parameter and the MLE fit negated the shape; GEV
  return-level callers no longer negate the shape.
- `compute_lmoments` (public) returns the first two L-moments and the
  L-skewness and L-kurtosis ratios.
- GEV metrics are named by return period (`gev_rp10`, `gev_rp50`,
  `gev_rp100`), replacing the mislabeled `gev_q10`/`gev_q50`/`gev_q100`.
- Breaking: `NowakDisaggregator` constructor arguments renamed for
  timescale-neutral clarity: `max_month_shift` is now
  `max_knn_pool_shift_timesteps` and `blend_days` is now
  `boundary_blend_timesteps`, both in units of output timesteps.
  Per-pair defaults apply when `max_knn_pool_shift_timesteps` is omitted
  (7 for monthly-to-daily, unchanged from before). The `KirschNowakPipeline`
  and `ThomasFieringNowakPipeline` public `max_month_shift` argument is
  unchanged. The legacy `disaggregate_monthly_flows()` method has been
  removed; use `disaggregate(ensemble, seed=...)`.
- `NowakDisaggregator` boundary smoothing now defaults to off
  (`boundary_blend_timesteps=0`, previously 2) so the default reproduces the
  published Nowak et al. (2010) method, which applies no boundary correction.
  Boundary smoothing remains available as an opt-in SynHydro extension.
- `KNNBootstrapGenerator` no longer accepts sub-monthly input. Restricted to
  monthly (Lall & Sharma, 1996; Prairie et al., 2006) and annual (Prairie et
  al., 2008) per the primary streamflow literature. Sub-monthly input now
  raises `ValueError`; for daily output, generate an annual realization and
  disaggregate with `NowakDisaggregator`. Daily KNN bootstrap in the
  literature is established only for weather variables (Rajagopalan and Lall,
  1999) or as a disaggregation step (Nowak et al., 2010), not as a standalone
  daily streamflow generator.
- Updated pandas frequency strings to current preferred names: `'AS'` ->
  `'YS'`, `'A'` -> `'YE'`, `'M'` -> `'ME'`. Input-alias sets in ARFIMA,
  WARM, and SMARTA still accept both old and new aliases for compatibility
  with `pd.infer_freq()` on older pandas versions.
- Reorganized generators into three classification bins based on the
  mathematical character of their generative mechanism (Studnicka and Panu,
  2025): `synhydro.methods.generation.parametric` (Thomas-Fiering, Matalas,
  ARFIMA, SPARTA, SMARTA, MS-HMM), `synhydro.methods.generation.hybrid`
  (Kirsch, WARM, Phase Randomization, MS Phase Randomization, HMM-KNN), and
  `synhydro.methods.generation.nonparametric` (KNN-Bootstrap). Top-level
  `synhydro.<Generator>` imports are unchanged.
- **Breaking:** `KirschGenerator` internal attribute renames to be
  resolution-agnostic: `n_months` -> `n_periods_per_year`,
  `mean_month` -> `mean_period`, `std_month` -> `std_period`, and the public
  property `Q_obs_monthly` -> `Q_obs_aggregated`. Downstream callers
  referencing these attributes (e.g., custom plotting code) must update.
  `MatalasGenerator` and `ThomasFieringGenerator` retain their original
  `Q_obs_monthly` naming.
- Migrated all generators to `np.random.Generator` (replaces legacy `np.random`)
- Replaced all `print()` with `logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Major API refactor: standardized preprocessing/fit/generate interface
- Improved ensemble HDF5 loading performance
- Stedinger transform lower bound now correctly falls back to tau=0
  when the formula produces values outside the valid range
- Pinned minimum dependency versions in pyproject.toml
- Test fixtures produce physically realistic (non-negative) streamflow data
- SSI clip floor is now configurable via `cdf_epsilon` (keyword-only); the
  default changed from an implicit +/- 6.36 bound to +/- 4.5 to suppress
  gamma-tail extrapolation artifacts. Pre-existing values previously below
  -4.5 or above +4.5 will now be clipped to those bounds.
- Renamed package from SGLib to SynHydro

### Fixed
- Matalas correlation matrix repair via shared `repair_correlation_matrix`
- KNN Bootstrap `block_size` and `index_site` parameters
- Multisite `ValueError` for univariate generators
- Nowak non-leap-year February bug
- Kirsch correlation matrix bug
- Kirsch `generate()` and `generate_from_indices()` now build X' as the
  deterministic 6-month shift of X per Kirsch et al. (2013), p. 6, rather
  than an independent bootstrap (`generate()`) or a shared-index lookup
  (`generate_from_indices()`). All three entry points
  (`generate`/`generate_single_series`, `generate_from_indices`,
  `generate_from_residuals`) are now statistically equivalent and route
  through a shared `_pipeline_from_X` helper. Breaking for seed-level
  reproducibility: `.generate(seed=S)` produces different numerical output
  than prior releases (the corrected distribution).
- Kirsch `generate_from_residuals` now requires residuals of shape
  `(n_years + 1, n_periods_per_year, n_sites)`, matching
  `generate_from_indices`, instead of duplicating the last residual row,
  which made the last two synthetic years share an identical second half.
  Breaking for external callers that passed exactly `n_years` rows. The
  docstring now states that residuals must already be in the normal-score
  space when `generate_using_log_flow=True` and that only the inverse
  transform is applied.
- Kirsch weekly output DatetimeIndex is now built per synthetic year using
  `pd.Timestamp.fromisocalendar(y, w, 7)` instead of a plain
  `pd.date_range(freq="W-SUN")`. The previous range marched in 7-day steps
  across year boundaries, accumulating a ~1.25 day/year backward drift (since
  52 x 7 = 364 days), which manifested as a multi-week leftward shift in
  seasonal-cycle plots over multi-decade horizons. Each synthetic position
  `k` of year `y` now lands on the Sunday of ISO week `(k+1)` of `y` so the
  per-period mean/std applied at fit time aligns with the calendar week of
  the labeled date.
- SSI Python version compatibility issue
- SSI deprecated pandas `"M"` frequency string (now `"ME"`)
- Valencia-Schaake divide-by-zero in correlation matrix computation
- RuntimeWarnings from `np.log` on edge-case data in Stedinger transform
  and HMM preprocessing

### Removed
- CRPS metrics (`crps_mean`, `crpss`): probabilistic-forecast scores do
  not apply to stochastic generation, where realizations are
  independent draws rather than date-aligned forecasts.
- Ideal-value and ensemble-size-dependent metrics: `ks_pvalue`, pooled
  `monthly_wilcoxon_pvalue`, `fdc_envelope_coverage`,
  `spectral_correlation`, `low_freq_ratio`, `variance_ratio`,
  `acf_rmse`, `monthly_*_bias` aggregates, and the cross-category
  `mean_absolute_relative_error` summary score, which averaged
  incommensurable quantities.
- The `core/validation/` package, replaced by `synhydro.verification`
  and `synhydro.validation`.
- Dead legacy `synhydro.verification` package (pre-refactor SSI code).
- Deprecated Kirsch-Nowak combined generator
- Outdated `core/validation.py` monolith (replaced by `core/validation/` package)
