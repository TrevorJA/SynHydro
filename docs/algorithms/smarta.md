## Overview

SMARTA generates stationary synthetic timeseries with arbitrary marginal distributions and any-range autocorrelation structure (short-range or long-range / Hurst-Kolmogorov). The core idea is to simulate an auxiliary standard Gaussian process using the Symmetric Moving Average (SMA) model, then map the Gaussian variates to the target domain via their inverse CDF. Because Pearson correlation is not invariant under this nonlinear transformation, the Gaussian process must use "equivalent" (inflated) correlation coefficients, identified through the Nataf joint distribution model. In multivariate mode the model additionally preserves the lag-0 cross-correlation matrix across sites.

## Formulation

### Nataf Mapping (Gaussian to Target Domain)

Each auxiliary Gaussian variate is mapped to the target domain by:

$$
x_t^i = F_{x^i}^{-1}\!\left(\Phi(z_t^i)\right)
$$

This guarantees exact preservation of the target marginal distribution.

### Equivalent Correlation Identification

Because Pearson's correlation is not invariant under the nonlinear ICDF mapping, the target correlation $\rho$ and equivalent Gaussian-domain correlation $\tilde{\rho}$ are related by:

$$
\rho = \mathcal{F}(\tilde{\rho} \mid F_{x^i}, F_{x^j})
= \frac{
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
  F_{x^i}^{-1}(\Phi(z^i))\;
  F_{x^j}^{-1}(\Phi(z^j))\;
  \phi_2(z^i, z^j;\, \tilde{\rho})\; dz^i\, dz^j
  \;-\; E[x^i]\, E[x^j]
}{
  \sqrt{Var[x^i]\; Var[x^j]}
}
$$

Key properties (Lemmas from the paper):
- $\rho$ is a strictly increasing function of $\tilde{\rho}$
- $|\rho| \leq |\tilde{\rho}|$ (equality only when both marginals are Gaussian)
- $\tilde{\rho} = 0$ iff $\rho = 0$

The relationship $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ generally has no closed-form solution (exception: log-normal case, Eq. 18-19 in paper). It is approximated numerically following the procedure of Appendix A in the paper (see also Tsoukalas et al., 2018a):

1. Select $\Omega$ support points $\tilde{\rho}_k$ in $[-1, 1]$ (default $\Omega = 9$).
2. For each support point, evaluate $\rho_k = \mathcal{F}(\tilde{\rho}_k)$ by Monte Carlo simulation: draw $N$ bivariate normal pairs $(z^i, z^j)$ with correlation $\tilde{\rho}_k$, map through the ICDFs, and compute the sample Pearson correlation. The paper recommends $N = 150{,}000$.
3. Fit a polynomial of degree $d$ (default $d = 8$) through the $(\tilde{\rho}_k, \rho_k)$ pairs.
4. Invert the polynomial: evaluate it densely over $[-1, 1]$ and interpolate to find $\tilde{\rho}$ for each target $\rho$. (The anySim R package uses `polyval` on a fine grid followed by linear interpolation.)

Alternative integration methods (Gauss-Hermite quadrature, numerical integration) can replace the Monte Carlo step but may be less robust for discrete or mixed-type marginals.

This procedure is applied a total of $m(m+1)/2$ times:
- $m$ times for autocorrelation (one per site, each producing the full equivalent ACF vector $\tilde{\rho}_1^i, \ldots, \tilde{\rho}_q^i$)
- $m(m-1)/2$ times for lag-0 cross-correlations (one per site pair, each producing a single $\tilde{\rho}_0^{i,j}$)

### Cauchy-type Autocorrelation Structure (CAS)

CAS is a two-parameter theoretical ACF that captures both SRD and LRD:

$$
\rho_\tau^{CAS} = (1 + \kappa \beta \tau)^{-1/\beta}, \qquad \tau \geq 0
$$

Special cases:
- $\beta > 1$: long-range dependence (approximates HK/fGn behavior). When $\kappa = \kappa_0$ (see Eq. 8 in paper), CAS closely matches the fGn ACF with $H$ related by $\beta = 1/(2 - 2H)$.
- $\beta = 0$ (via L'Hopital): $\rho_\tau = \exp(-\kappa \tau)$, which is SRD (Markovian/AR(1) type).

Parameters $\kappa$ and $\beta$ are estimated by minimizing MSE between sample and theoretical ACF or climacogram. The paper recommends using the climacogram for parameter identification, especially for LRD processes, because it exhibits less bias and uncertainty in its estimation compared to the ACF (Dimitriadis & Koutsoyiannis, 2015).

### SMA Model (Auxiliary Gaussian Process)

The univariate SMA generating mechanism is:

$$
z_t^i = \sum_{\zeta=-q}^{q} \tilde{a}_{|\zeta|}^i \; v_{t+\zeta}^i
$$

where $v_t^i$ are i.i.d. standard normal, and the symmetric weights $\tilde{a}_\zeta^i$ satisfy:

$$
\tilde{\rho}_\tau^i = \sum_{\zeta=-q}^{q-\tau} \tilde{a}_{|\zeta|}^i \; \tilde{a}_{|\tau+\zeta|}^i, \qquad \tau = 0, 1, \ldots, q
$$

The weights are computed via FFT (Koutsoyiannis, 2000). Form the full symmetric equivalent ACF vector of length $2q+1$: $[\tilde{\rho}_q, \ldots, \tilde{\rho}_1, 1, \tilde{\rho}_1, \ldots, \tilde{\rho}_q]$. Compute its DFT to get the power spectrum $S_{\tilde{\rho}}(\omega)$. The DFT of the weight sequence is $S_{\tilde{a}}(\omega) = \sqrt{|S_{\tilde{\rho}}(\omega)|}$ (absolute value guards against small negative values from numerical imprecision). Apply the inverse FFT to obtain the weights $\tilde{a}_\zeta$. The weights must satisfy $\sum_\zeta \tilde{a}_\zeta^2 = 1$ (i.e., $\tilde{\rho}_0 = 1$).

Note: The paper (referencing Koutsoyiannis, 2000) writes $S_{\tilde{a}}(\omega) = \sqrt{2 S_{\tilde{\rho}}(\omega)}$ using a one-sided spectral convention. When using the full two-sided symmetric ACF as input to the DFT (as in the anySim R implementation), the factor of 2 is not needed.

### Multivariate Extension

For $m > 1$ sites, innovations $v_t^i$ must be contemporaneously cross-correlated. Define:

$$
\tilde{g}^{i,j} = \frac{\tilde{\rho}_0^{i,j}}{\sum_{\zeta=-q}^{q} \tilde{a}_{|\zeta|}^i \; \tilde{a}_{|\zeta|}^j}
$$

Form matrix $\tilde{G}$ with $\tilde{G}[i,j] = \tilde{g}^{i,j}$ and ones on the diagonal. Decompose $\tilde{G} = \tilde{B}\tilde{B}^\top$ via Cholesky (if positive definite) or nearest-PD correction. Generate correlated innovations: $\mathbf{v}_t = \tilde{B}\,\mathbf{w}_t$ where $\mathbf{w}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$.

### Parameter Estimation

1. **Marginal fitting:** Fit a distribution $F_{x^i}$ to each site's data (any distribution with finite variance).
2. **Autocorrelation fitting:** Fit CAS parameters $(\kappa^i, \beta^i)$ to each site's sample ACF or climacogram.
3. **Equivalent ACF:** For each site, compute $\tilde{\rho}_\tau^i$ for $\tau = 1, \ldots, q$ by inverting $\mathcal{F}$.
4. **SMA weights:** Compute $\tilde{a}_\zeta^i$ via FFT of the equivalent ACF.
5. **Equivalent cross-correlations:** For each pair $(i,j)$, compute $\tilde{\rho}_0^{i,j}$ by inverting $\mathcal{F}$.
6. **Cross-correlation decomposition:** Build $\tilde{G}$, decompose to get $\tilde{B}$.

### Synthesis Procedure

1. For each time step $t = 1, \ldots, T + 2q$, draw $\mathbf{w}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}_m)$.

2. Compute correlated innovations: $\mathbf{v}_t = \tilde{B}\,\mathbf{w}_t$ (univariate case: $\tilde{B} = 1$).

3. For each site $i = 1, \ldots, m$, compute the auxiliary Gaussian series via SMA convolution:

$$
z_t^i = \sum_{\zeta=-q}^{q} \tilde{a}_{|\zeta|}^i \; v_{t+\zeta}^i, \qquad t = 1, \ldots, T
$$

4. Map to the target domain:

$$
x_t^i = F_{x^i}^{-1}\!\left(\Phi(z_t^i)\right)
$$

## Statistical Properties

SMARTA exactly preserves the target marginal distribution at each site (by construction via the ICDF mapping). The theoretical autocorrelation structure is preserved up to lag $q$ in the Gaussian domain; in the actual domain, correlation preservation depends on the accuracy of the Nataf polynomial approximation. The lag-0 cross-correlation structure is preserved across sites to the extent that the matrix $\tilde{G}$ is positive definite and the Nataf inversion is accurate. Lagged cross-correlations ($\tau > 0$) are not explicitly modeled but emerge from the SMA convolution with shared temporal structure.

The model is capable of reproducing long-range dependence (Hurst-Kolmogorov behavior) through the CAS autocorrelation structure, which is a key advantage over ARMA-type models. The climacogram (variance vs. aggregation scale) provides a diagnostic that is less biased than the ACF for verifying LRD preservation.

## Limitations

- Requires target marginal distributions with finite variance (excludes heavy-tailed distributions with infinite second moment).
- The maximum attainable correlation in the target domain may be less than 1 when marginals are highly skewed or differ significantly between sites (Frechet-Hoeffding bounds).
- The Nataf polynomial inversion is an approximation; accuracy depends on the number and placement of evaluation points and polynomial degree.
- Only lag-0 cross-correlations are explicitly preserved; lagged cross-correlations are implicitly determined by the SMA structure and may not match observations.
- The model assumes stationarity. Seasonal nonstationarity must be handled externally (e.g., treating each month as a separate process as in the daily rainfall example).
- SMA order $q$ must be large enough for the target ACF to decay sufficiently; for strong LRD, this requires large $q$ (e.g., $2^{12}$), increasing memory and computation.
- The Nataf evaluation (Gauss-Hermite quadrature or Monte Carlo) can be slow when many sites and lags are involved ($m + m(m-1)/2$ inversions).

## Implementation Notes

- **FFT normalization:** NumPy's `np.fft.fft` uses the same convention as R's `fft()`. When computing weights from the full symmetric ACF of length $2q+1$, no normalization adjustment is needed. Clamp negative power spectrum values to zero before taking the square root.
- **Positive-definiteness:** After Nataf inversion, the matrix $\tilde{G}$ may not be positive definite. Use nearest-PD correction (e.g., `statsmodels.stats.correlation_tools.cov_nearest_factor_homog` or Higham's algorithm) before Cholesky decomposition.
- **Polynomial accuracy for skewed marginals:** For highly skewed or zero-inflated distributions, the $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ relationship is strongly nonlinear. The 8th-degree polynomial may oscillate near the bounds. Validate that interpolated $\tilde{\rho}$ values lie in $[-1, 1]$ and clip if necessary.
- **Reference R implementation:** The `anySim` R package (https://github.com/itsoukal/anySim) by the paper's authors provides a validated implementation with functions `EstSMARTA()` and `SimSMARTA()`.
